# Module 7: CNNs from Scratch

**Focus:** Convolutional layers, pooling, complete CNN

## ðŸŽ¯ Coding Tasks

### Task 1: 2D Convolution
- [ ] Implement conv2d (forward pass)
- [ ] Handle padding and stride
- [ ] Support multiple channels
- [ ] Test on sample inputs

**Files to create:**
- `conv_layers.py`

---

### Task 2: Pooling Layers
- [ ] Max pooling (forward + backward)
- [ ] Average pooling (forward + backward)
- [ ] Test gradient flow

**Files to create:**
- `pooling_layers.py`

---

### Task 3: CNN Backpropagation
- [ ] Convolution backward pass
- [ ] Pooling backward pass
- [ ] Verify with numerical gradients

**Files to create:**
- `conv_backprop.py`

---

### Task 4: Complete CNN Architecture
- [ ] Build Conv â†’ ReLU â†’ MaxPool â†’ FC
- [ ] Forward pass through entire network
- [ ] Backward pass through entire network

**Files to create:**
- `cnn_model.py`

---

### Project: MNIST CNN (>98% accuracy)
- [ ] Build CNN architecture
- [ ] Train on MNIST
- [ ] Achieve >98% accuracy
- [ ] Visualize learned filters
- [ ] Analyze layer activations

**Files to create:**
- `mnist_cnn.ipynb`

---
