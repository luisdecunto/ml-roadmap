# Module 10: Transformers from Scratch

**Focus:** Attention, multi-head attention, complete transformer

## ðŸŽ¯ Coding Tasks

### Task 1: Scaled Dot-Product Attention
- [ ] Implement attention mechanism
- [ ] Add masking support
- [ ] Test on sample sequences

**Files to create:**
- `attention.py`

---

### Task 2: Multi-Head Attention
- [ ] Split into multiple heads
- [ ] Parallel attention computations
- [ ] Concatenate and project

**Files to create:**
- `multi_head_attention.py`

---

### Task 3: Positional Encoding
- [ ] Sinusoidal positional encoding
- [ ] Add to embeddings
- [ ] Visualize encoding patterns

**Files to create:**
- `positional_encoding.py`

---

### Task 4: Transformer Blocks
- [ ] Encoder block (self-attention + FFN)
- [ ] Decoder block (masked attention + cross-attention + FFN)
- [ ] Layer normalization
- [ ] Residual connections

**Files to create:**
- `transformer_blocks.py`

---

### Task 5: Complete Transformer
- [ ] Stack encoder layers
- [ ] Stack decoder layers
- [ ] Full forward pass
- [ ] Implement teacher forcing

**Files to create:**
- `transformer.py`

---

### Project: Mini Sequence-to-Sequence
- [ ] Implement toy task (reverse, copy, or addition)
- [ ] Train transformer
- [ ] Achieve good accuracy
- [ ] Visualize attention patterns

**Files to create:**
- `seq2seq_transformer.ipynb`

---
