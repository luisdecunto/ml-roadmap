# Math Foundations - Coding Projects

This directory contains your hands-on implementations for the Math Foundations roadmap.

## 📁 Structure

Each module folder contains your coding work for that topic. Work through them in order, implementing algorithms from scratch.

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Read the coding guide** from the main roadmap (click the 💻 Coding Guide links)
2. **Create your files** in the corresponding module folder
3. **Implement from scratch** - no ML libraries! Use NumPy only
4. **Test your implementations** - verify with numerical gradients
5. **Track your progress** - check off tasks in the main roadmap

## 🎯 What to Create in Each Module

### Use `.py` files for:
- Clean implementations you can reuse
- Functions and classes
- Testing/validation code

### Use `.ipynb` notebooks for:
- Step-by-step learning
- Experiments and visualizations
- Training runs
- Plots and analysis

## 📊 Recommended Workflow

```bash
# Example: Working on Module 1
cd "Module 1 - Linear Algebra"

# Create a notebook to explore
jupyter notebook matrix_multiplication.ipynb

# Once you understand it, create clean implementation
# matrix_ops.py

# Test it in another notebook
# test_and_visualize.ipynb
```

## ✅ Progress Tracking

Mark your progress in each module's README.md file (created automatically).

## 🚀 Tips

- **Start simple**: Get basic version working first
- **Verify with numerical gradients**: Catch bugs early
- **Visualize**: Plot activations, gradients, loss curves
- **Compare with PyTorch**: Validate your implementations
- **Commit often**: Track your learning journey

**Remember:** The goal is to deeply understand how everything works. Take your time and experiment!
