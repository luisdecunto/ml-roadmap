# Module 1: Linear Algebra

**Focus:** Matrix operations, eigenvalues, SVD from scratch

## ðŸŽ¯ Coding Tasks

### Task 1: Matrix Multiplication (3 implementations)
- [ ] Naive triple loop
- [ ] Vectorized with NumPy
- [ ] Compare performance

**Files to create:**
- `matrix_multiplication.py` or `matrix_multiplication.ipynb`

**Reference:** [Linear Algebra Coding Guide](../guides/linear_algebra_coding_guide.html)

---

### Task 2: Power Iteration for Eigenvalues
- [ ] Implement power iteration algorithm
- [ ] Find dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector
- [ ] Test on sample matrices

**Files to create:**
- `power_iteration.py` or `power_iteration.ipynb`

---

### Task 3: SVD from Scratch
- [ ] Implement Singular Value Decomposition
- [ ] Verify: A = U @ Î£ @ V^T
- [ ] Test on various matrices

**Files to create:**
- `svd_implementation.py` or `svd_implementation.ipynb`

---

### Project: Image Compression
- [ ] Load an image
- [ ] Apply SVD
- [ ] Compress by keeping top k singular values
- [ ] Visualize quality vs compression ratio

**Files to create:**
- `image_compression.ipynb` (notebook recommended for visualizations)

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

- All implementations work correctly
- Numerical verification passes
- Image compression shows clear trade-off
- You understand the math behind each algorithm
