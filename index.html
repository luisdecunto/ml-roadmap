                                            <strong>Recommended Approach:</strong> Work through 1-2 modules per week (~10 hours/week) alongside your main ML roadmap.
                                            Focus on understanding over speed. Implement everything from scratch in NumPy before using PyTorch - this builds deep intuition.
