## Progress Tracking

Use checkboxes above to track your progress. Aim for:
- **1-2 modules per week** alongside main roadmap
- **~10 hours per week** on math foundations
- **Focus on understanding over speed**

---

## Why This Matters

When you interview for ML Engineer positions, you'll be able to:

✅ "I implemented backpropagation from first principles in NumPy"  
✅ "I built a transformer architecture from scratch and understand the math"  
✅ "I can derive the gradient equations for Adam optimizer"  
✅ "I understand attention mechanisms mathematically, not just `nn.MultiheadAttention`"  
✅ "I implemented CNNs in pure NumPy to understand convolution backprop"

**This is what separates senior ML Engineers from bootcamp graduates.** 🚀

*Work through this at your own pace. The goal is deep understanding, not rushing through checkboxes.*
