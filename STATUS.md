## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Progress Tracking
- Uses `localStorage` for client-side persistence
- Key format: `ml-roadmap-progress`
- GitHub sync via API (requires token for edit mode)
- Progress saved to `progress.json` in repository

### Task Rendering
- Tasks support HTML via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Guide links embedded in task strings with inline styles
- Example: `"Setup PostgreSQL (<a href='guides/postgresql_setup.html' target='_blank' style='color: #2563eb; font-weight: 600;'>📖 Setup Guide</a>)"`

### Guide HTML Template Pattern
All guides use same pattern:
1. Load markdown file via `fetch('guide_name.md')`
2. Parse with `marked.js`
3. Render into `.markdown-body` div
4. Consistent styling (Tailwind CSS)
5. Navigation back to roadmap

**This requires BOTH `.html` and `.md` files to be uploaded to GitHub!**

---

## 📊 Guide Creation Template

When creating a new guide, follow this pattern:

### 1. Create `.md` file with content
```markdown
# Guide Title

**Time:** X hours
**Difficulty:** Level
**Prerequisites:** List

## What You'll Build
- Item 1
- Item 2

## Part 1: Topic
[Detailed content]

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2

## Resources
- [Link 1](url)
```

### 2. Create `.html` wrapper
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Guide Title - ML Roadmap</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Styling from existing guides -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Header with back button -->
    <!-- Content container -->
    <script>
        fetch('guide_name.md')
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(markdown => {
                document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = marked.parse(markdown);
            });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Link in `index.html`
Update task text:
```javascript
"Code: Task description (<a href='guides/guide_name.html' target='_blank' style='color: #10b981; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;'>💻 Coding Guide</a>)"
```

### 4. Commit both files
```bash
git add guides/guide_name.html guides/guide_name.md
git commit -m "Add [topic] coding guide"
git push
```

---

## 🎨 Color Scheme

window.dispatchEvent(new StorageEvent('storage', {
    key: 'exercise-completions',
    newValue: JSON.stringify(state),
    url: window.location.href,
    storageArea: localStorage
}));

// Main roadmap listens for changes
useEffect(() => {
    const handleStorageChange = (e) => {
        if (e.key === 'exercise-completions') {
            setCheckedTasks(prev => ({...prev})); // Force re-render
        }
    };
    window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
}, []);
```

**Progress Calculation:**
```javascript
const exerciseModules = {
    "Linear Algebra Exercises": { prefix: 'linear-algebra-', total: 22 },
    "Calculus & Gradients Exercises": { prefix: 'calculus-gradients-', total: 23 },
    "Optimization Exercises": { prefix: 'optimization-', total: 20 },
